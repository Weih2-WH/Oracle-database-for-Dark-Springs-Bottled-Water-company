Business Summary:
* Dark Springs specialized in delivering bottled water to customers. It needs a database to manage the orders and make sure the customers never run out of water.   
* Dark Springs uses information from customers to estimate initial monthly usage and monthly cost and schedule enough deliveries.  After that, weekly usage of water of each customer will be estimated, and then scheduled delivery for water coolers.    
* For SME customers, Dark Springs ask for a deposit on water cooler for rent, and the deposit returns to customer when coolers returned, for large customers, deposit is waived.  All deliveries and sales should be recorded, including time of deliver, customer comments, and special requests for delivery.   
* Bills are sent monthly and recorded by accounting stuff. Dark Springs rewards customers who refer new customers, with a discount recorded on monthly bill. Bills should have monthly fee amount, locations of customer consolidated, and number of days of service recorded.   
* Dark Spring also wants to use database to help analyze the evaluation data for report purpose. The manager will record weekly valuation for each employee including number of deliveries, the amount of additional sales, and number of leads. Combined with subjective consideration of difficulty and distance of route, a report will be filled out every month to evaluate the status of driver.
