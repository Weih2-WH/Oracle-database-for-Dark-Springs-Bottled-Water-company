De-normalize Vehicle table and delivery table
We initially separated the Vehicle information from delivery to normalize the data. However, we later discovered that the separate Vehicle table had more drawbacks than benefits for our purposes. This is because normalization is intended to reduce data redundancy, but in the case of the Vehicle data, we only require the license plate number, which is the sole piece of information stored in the Vehicle table. To achieve normalization, we would need to add a UID for each vehicle, resulting in the database storing additional information beyond just the license plate number. As a result, the benefits of normalization in this scenario were outweighed by the drawbacks.

Additionally, in our assumptions, we found that most of the time when we need delivery information, we also need the license plate number. With this in mind, every time we required the vehicle information, we had to join another table, Vehicle, to obtain the information, which made the query more complicated. Consequently, we decided to denormalize this table, Vehicle, and place the vehicle information in the delivery table instead of separating it into a distinct table.
